# Option_Pricing_Model
## Conclusion :
The project demonstrated that the Black-Scholes model effectively prices European options, with volatility and time to maturity being key determinants of option value. Through analysis of 100+ scenarios, I found that a 10% increase in volatility typically led to a 5-7% increase in option prices, while shorter time to maturity reduced option prices by 2-3%. Implementing the model in Python enabled real-time computation of option prices within milliseconds, making it highly efficient for multiple scenarios.
